# Website

A static personal site to show off some of my work and to keep from forgetting too much

# Requirements
You will need `yarn` installed.

# Starting

Run the following to build the files in `./src`.
```
yarn start
```

To actually build the deployment package:

```
yarn build
```


# Releasing

The application is hosted on [github](http://github.com) so pushing to the `gh-pages` branch deploys whatever has been built.
