## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family

- We all went to San Diego for New Year's with a few friends. It was nice to explore a new city even though it was pretty chilly for the beach. Still a memorable time, and seeing LegoLand at Christmas time was magical. The Two Day Pass was definitely worth it, since it felt less cramped than when we tried to do it in one day.
- New neighbors

## 🧑‍💻 Work

- In December, I went on a New York trip for the holiday party, and it was delightful to see how lit up the city gets for Christmas. There is also something invigorating about quarterly trips to help me stay engaged with the people that I do not get to see in person.

## 🍿 Media Consumption

- [The Book of Joy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29496453-the-book-of-joy) was the most impactful book of the quarter for me. Largely focused on how Buddhists and Christians consider joy, it was a nice practical guide to some of the more intellectual topics I have read about meditation, and it was nice to have the same ideas echoed through the teachings of Jesus.
- With Logan, I have been re-watching all of the Star Wars movies, and even if they are not the nostalgia wellspring for me that they are for many others, seeing them through the eyes of a six year old makes them really sparkle in a fun way.

## 🎲 Games

- Video games have largely not been monopolizing my life, but [Nuclear Throne](https://store.steampowered.com/app/242680/Nuclear_Throne/) got quite a bit of play, despite it being an old game and very very hard for me. It is fun to have a game that reminds me of Sonic that I played when I was young and just lost on level 2 or 3 over and over while still enjoying it.
- The [RoguePodLiteCast](https://roguepod.show/) podcast is wonderful and keeps me exploring new games. Several of the ones they enjoy are not my favorite, but their friendly banter and deep analysis of game mechanics is so much fun, even for games I know I am not going to dig into deeply.

## 🧠 Thinking About

- Slightly cheating to just be replaying what I'm doing in therapy, but I am learning to incorporate distance between reaction and response to situations. When something goes sideways, I have tended to just snap whatever I was feeling and am trying to instead recognize that impulse and think about how I will have wanted to respond. This is a continuous learning process, but when I succeed in taking a breath, it has felt like a super power.
