## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family

- Neem is doing great, but none of us are sleeping well with all the life transitions. She is still doing iOS dev at Stitch Fix.
- Rory was born on June 19. Everything went great and we are learning to deal with a little less sleep.
- Logan is 3 (and a half according to him) and loving his time at Forsyth School.
- We are stopping at 2 kids, but cannot wait to go on adventures together. Next big one is Cancun in March.

## 🧑‍💻 Work

- I am doing front-end platform work at Stitch Fix.
- My primary focus is on the design system, but I am playing with NextJS quite a bit too.
- We are spending time on migrating to a monorepo using TurboRepo.

## 🍿 Media Consumption

- We are mostly keeping up on all the Marvel and Star Wars shows. Andor has been lagging a little, but we will catch up.
- [The Sandman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1751634) was fascinating and a great adaptation of the book.
- I have been posting all of my movie reviews on Mastodon. The one I think is a must-watch is [The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934).](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025748/)
- TikTok and Youtube take up too much time in my life and I am actively working on replacing them with things like podcasts.

## 🎲 Games

- [Vintage Rotisserie Draft at St Lotus](https://stlotus.org) has gotten bumped a few times due to my health, but is hopefully coming back in 2023.
- [Marvel Snap](https://www.marvelsnap.com/) has been dominating my phone gaming time. It is addictive and quick, with a good progression system.
- Board games haven't been much of a focus recently, but I am probably going to spend some time on [Marvel Champions LCG](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/marvel-champions-the-card-game/) as winter comes.
- I got a PS5 and mostly use it to play Fortnite, but I was pretty excited to get the Spider-Gwen outfit.

## 🎨 Creation

- Planning is already happening for the next 7 Day RogueLike. Very likely it will be out of zeitgeist by then, but a game where you run a social media company sounds like fun.
- My lack of SQL knowledge is really stalling some work I want to do on St Lotus card rankings.
- Logan and I have been building Legos together. We have completed a Saturn V rocket and the Space Shuttle Discovery. Also many Logan-designed cars that he loves.

## 🧠 Thinking About

- What work success means to me. Moving up a career ladder or down in hours is no longer my goal at work, so figuring out what it is has been taking time.
- How to raise children. I know a lot of my personal values, but finding what to pass on to my children and how takes a lot of thought and planning.
