## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family

- Our family is full of so much excitement and busyness. It feels like every day of the week we are getting the kiddos at five after their activities, getting dinner, and then rushing to bed. I wish I could be spending more chill time with them.
- Logan has taken to bike-riding like a fish to water after getting a big-kid bike for his fifth birthday. He followed his Uncle Tim's training guide and is flying around parking lots. There are still some control issues that make me leery of sidewalks, but we are on our way.
- We had a wonderful journey out to Valier, IL to view the Solar Eclipse this year. My parents, sister with family, and brother came down to the home of my friend and we were able to see the eclipse from totality. It is truly breathtaking and a once-in-a-lifetime event that we have managed to see twice so far.

## 🧑‍💻 Work

- I hit my one-year anniversary at [OpsLevel](https://www.opslevel.com/). It's going well and the constant battle of what is worth doing to make the future easier is much harder to make decisions about when you're a Series A start-up. Finding the trade-offs and defaulting to trying things with the assumption that a partial feature is better than a perfectly scalable feature is a new experience that still feels fun.
- Tech still feels like the right fit for now, but basically all of my interest is either in game-development (which isn't tenable for financial reasons), or in other arenas. There is no itch for me to jump careers at the moment, and I don't even feel like I am burnt out, but work has never felt more like a job. My default assumption is that this is largely driven by remote-culture, since I really struggle to self-fund my motivation and generally receive energy from others in the workplace.

## 🍿 Media Consumption

- Movie night is going strong, with the highest point for me being [The Holdovers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14849194/), but I have been making a point of watching all of the movies from [Orphaned Entertainment](https://www.orphanedentertainment.com/) as well, which has exposed me to many more old films that are largely not great, but are always interesting.
- Tons of books have been read, but nothing really stood out as incredible so far. [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/11634) says that I have read 28 so far this year, but very few five stars. Some high school classics that I had never read did manage to break through however: [Watership Down](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76620.Watership_Down), and [The Old Man and the Sea](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2165.The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea).

## 🎲 Games

- [Marvel Snap](https://www.marvelsnap.com/) is probably still my primary game at this point, which still carries the same feeling of obligation rather than true immersion that often comes in mobile games. I did fall deeply in love with the casual game [Hardspace: Shipbreaker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1161580/Hardspace_Shipbreaker/) as well, and got all the trophies before setting it down.
- Lego has been a good time, both individually (doing a big Star Trek set) and working with Logan on it, since he likes the parallel play and doing a big set "together".

## 🎨 Creation

- I finished the series of [YouTube Shorts](https://www.youtube.com/@stlotus/shorts) for Vintage Rotisserie Draft, which was fun, but definitely burnt me out in the end. We have another big event coming up in May, so that will be a good time, but trying to get the daily content out is such a chore.
- I succumbed to temptation and threw together a game for the [7 Day RogueLike](https://7drl.com/) after saying that I probably would not do it. [Ric-Rac-Rogue](https://katerberg.github.io/ric-rac-rogue/) was a lot of fun to build, and even though people are in conflict over whether it is a roguelike, I still love it. I wish I had more time for it like always, but it is probably the one I feel I should be most proud of finishing.

## 🧠 Thinking About

- Due to weird health stuff with my sinuses, most of my time has been more about surviving than actually contemplating life. I look forward to having a healthy body that lets me go to bed without feeling completely exhausted, and hopefully by then, life will stay at the same slower pace where I can do things more mindfully.
- The biggest focus of my past quarter has been about being intentional with the kids. Finding a way to ensure that every night we do something together and that I am not just dropping them to their own things while I am on my phone near them, but instead spending time engaging with them has been my goal. This particularly matters with Rory, since she is little and it is much easier to play with Logan since he engages more.
