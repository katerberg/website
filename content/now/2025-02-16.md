## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family

- So much traveling! We went to Hong Kong to visit Craig, Cristina, Gabri, and Mateo, with a brief stop in Japan since it is a short stop over. Neem and Logan went to Austin to visit family, and had two canceled trips as well, including one that was canceled while it was trying to land resulting in a long trip that ended up in the same airport (STL).
- Logan has been enjoying [Cub Scouts](https://www.scouting.org/), with a completed pinewood derby car to show for it as well as a lot of badges from the events we did last Autumn. We are both looking forward to hiking more in the Spring.
- As a family, we saw the [Ambassadors of Harmony](https://aoh.org/) concert which was run by his former teacher, and Logan and I went to see [How The Grinch Stole Christmas](https://www.fabulousfox.com/events/detail/grinch) at the Fox Theater as well. Doing events like this are always a big investment in energy, time, and money, but still feel worth it.

## 🧑‍💻 Work

- I am still at [OpsLevel](https://www.opslevel.com/). We recently launched [UI Customization](https://docs.opslevel.com/docs/ui-customization) to much excitement, and I did most of the fighting for a widgetized layout that was well received.
- Not seeing my co-workers has been pretty draining emotionally, but I have come more to peace with it given how flexible the role is, both in terms of time as well as in the amount of latitude I am given to build what makes sense in this crazy start up world.

## 🍿 Media Consumption

- [Star Trek: Voyager](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112178/) has been my comfort watch, but I probably watch one episode a month given how much I have been reading and watching of films that require more focus.
- I watched a 12 hour viewing of [Lord of the Rings](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/) at the [Hi-Pointe Theater](https://hipointetheatre.org/movies/the-lord-of-the-rings-extended-edition-trilogy-marathon/) with some friends which was really fun but also very long.

## 🎲 Games

- [Rogue Legacy 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1253920/Rogue_Legacy_2/) is a good one that Logan enjoys watching me play, and it is scratching my desire for a Rogue-lite while still being easy enough that I am not stressed when I have to set it down to help with something.
- Despite [St Lotus](https://stlotus.org) streaming slowing down, I have still been playing more Magic, and even got to play in a couple VRDs recently. My performance has not been where I want it to be, but it is still fun and I am trying to get myself more comfortable at doing things sub-optimally.

## 🎨 Creation

- Not much creation happening recently other than putting together some Lego sets (such as the [Perseverance Rover](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/nasa-mars-rover-perseverance-42158)) that I got for Christmas, but we are in the thick of family time, so much of my creation has been on bonds with family.
- While not really focusing on it, I still enjoy spending 30 seconds each morning improving my Latte Art. I am wildly inconsistent, but occasionally [things work out the way they should](https://mastodonapp.uk/@katerberg/113204276529023630). Most of my problem is that the time between creations is about 24 hours, so it is hard to remember what I am trying to improve.

## 🧠 Thinking About

- I had a surgery to improve my sinuses that went well, but I have a sleep study coming up that will likely diagnose me with sleep apnea as well. Getting old is tiring and I hope that focusing on my physical and mental health will pay dividends in forty years, even if it is annoying now.
- How to be a better husband. The more I learn about how my brain works, the more I am aware of the ways that I want to be more in control of how it functions. Like everyone, I look back at past me and realize the ways in which I have been just vaguely inconsiderate without intention. Similar to last quarter's goal of focusing energy on time with children, I am thinking of ways to ensure that I can be more kind to Neem.
