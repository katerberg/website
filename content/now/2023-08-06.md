## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family

- Our family has had a lot of sickness, but nothing critical. As I write this, I am on antibiotics and steroids for some kind of tonsil infection, Logan is on antibiotics for strep, and Rory is on antibiotics for an ear infection. Neem is healthy as a change of pace.
- Rory loves exploring and has been insistent on having books read to her, which is adorable. Her favorite is [The Itsy Bitsy Pumpkin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18812587-the-itsy-bitsy-pumpkin).

## 🧑‍💻 Work

- I am still working at [OpsLevel](https://opslevel.com). It's been a good experience and although start-ups are chaotic, I feel like I'm finding a solid balance that lets me leave work after work.
- The struggle to upgrade old libraries is still ongoing, but I have merged over 60 upgrades so far, and there are only a few more big ones left before we are fully caught up.

## 🍿 Media Consumption

- We are struggling to keep up with all of the Marvel and Star Wars shows and movies, but so far have managed to do so. None of them have stood out enough to mention, but all are still enjoyable enough.
- The weekly movie night has been helpful in expanding tastes and I have found a few that I really enjoyed, including [Top Hat](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027125/), which has moments that are on-par with the Marx Brothers, as well as more serious films like [The Banshees of Inisherin](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11813216).

## 🎲 Games

- [Spider-Man 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_2_(2023_video_game)) came out! It was exactly what I wanted from the game, which added enough interesting pieces from the first two without losing the core fun of the game. I finished it in about 16 hours and then hit 100% achievements by 26 hours. It was a little shorter than I hoped for, but I expect DLCs to add more soon.
- Marvel Snap has ramped up a little, but it's more of a time-filler now that I removed TikTok from my phone. That has been a really nice trade-off and I feel like I am spending more of my time fully-conscious.
- [St Lotus](https://stlotus.org) has our yearly city championship against Chicago, and we managed to pull out a 10-6 victory to claim the title. This was a fun experience for a few reasons:
  - We got to travel to Chicago to play on their turf.
  - I actually got to play because I was not just focused on hosting.
  - We played a team-draft, which is a format that has largely been unexplored in the rotisserie sphere.
  - We put in a lot of preparation time to get ready for the tournament, and it payed off with a win!

## 🎨 Creation

- I spent a lot of time building tooling for St Lotus, including migrating the website to [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/) and adding a few sections for top cards and bulk deck builder.
- My brain is already spinning on what to build for the next 7-Day Roguelike. I want to build a more traditional roguelike, but don't want to spend as much time on the tooling and boring things as I did the first time. This has led to me getting some thoughts down into a repository called [Splinter](https://github.com/katerberg/splinter) that hopefully can make the process less painful.

## 🧠 Thinking About

- How to function when it seems like our family is always in some stage of sickness.
- I really value family, both extended and immediate. I have been feeling incredibly grateful to be close with my immediate family and want to make sure my kids feel the same way. My parents are coming to visit for Thanksgiving and we get to go visit Michigan for Christmas, so my cup is feeling very full with love right now.

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family

- Rory is getting bigger by the day. She loves eating more than any kid I've seen, and she just took her first steps at 13 months.
- Logan is so full of love and excitement. He is really proud of biking on his balance bike and he loves giving advice on how to best play [Slay the Spire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire).
- Neem is still loving her job and is doing her best to live in the moment. It has been amazing for us to take trips, some together and some separate which have helped us remember that work isn't everything.

## 🧑‍💻 Work

- I am still working at [OpsLevel](https://opslevel.com), which has a great balance of passion for delivering features quickly (driven by actually being in a competitive market, which is something new to me compared to previous companies) and ensuring that the company has enough stability in people and product to be able to exist in five years.
- After getting my feet under me by doing some basic feature work, I have largely been hopping in to help speed big time-sensitive feature lifts across the line, or upgrading long-neglected libraries that have been slowing the team down for years.
- There was a fun journey about [Content Security Policies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) that I should probably write a blog post about. It started with a simple request to pass a security audit and ended up yak-shaving into a month long debacle where I learned a ton.

## 🍿 Media Consumption

- I was saddened to finish [The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5788792/), which was such an immersive visual time capsule. I don't think it was the greatest show of all time, but it is such a fun watch for people into comedy or who enjoyed the aesthetics of Mad Men.
- I went to Barbenheimer, which was like Peanut Butter and Chocolate, two great tastes that get better due to fantastic advertising. Because it's likely the last big blockbuster due to the WGA/SAG-AFTRA strike (which is a well-warranted strike), I wanted to see these in theaters and it was well worth it.

## 🎲 Games

- With the pending release of [Spider-Man 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_2_(2023_video_game)), I went back and finished getting 100% of the trophies for the previous two games. They are such immersive wonderful games that I hope the new one can live up to.
- Magic: the Gathering Arena and Marvel Snap still have a little bit of time on my mobile game rotation, but there hasn't been anything that has really bitten me recently so I'm hoping that I can find an RPG to fall into. Gaming with children requires such short attention spans that anything complex seems impossible right now.
- Slightly different than my normal games, but a group of us have been meeting up to play outdoor Racquetball every week and it has been a wonderful reminder than physical activity can actually be fun and competitive without being emotionally exhausting.

## 🎨 Creation

- Neem got me a gift of a solo hotel for Father's Day (after I did the same for Mother's Day (it's probably a new tradition)), and in the hotel, I built a [large Voyager set](https://files.mastodonapp.uk/media_attachments/files/110/640/029/438/880/795/original/8d1fa48889cdc3b5.jpeg) that is trying to find a permanent home on our shelves at home.
- There's a game-like concept I'm toying around with around Tessellations, but most of my off-work development time has been beefing up a lot of things for [St Lotus](https://stlotus.org) recently.

## 🧠 Thinking About

- What is family and how to keep engaged with it without spiraling into a cycle of over-investment and then frustration and exhaustion. Parenting either feels like a race to the bottom or a massive set of impossible expectations a lot of the time.
- How to compress more things into digestible chunks. Life feels like it operates in 10 minute increments, so I am trying to think about how to make things I want to do fall into those chunks. This largely means that I tend to stop doing creative endeavors because those are things that I need "mulling" time for.
