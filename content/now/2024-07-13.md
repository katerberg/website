## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family

- Our family is wonderful, with many trips to see the extended family (two to Austin and two to Chicago this quarter!) and it is wonderful to see the kiddos building great memories with their cousins.
- Logan has been riding his bike often, while Ororo is far more nervous around her trike, but is still a good sport because she wants to keep up with her brother. Neem has been venturing out more on family walks and it is good to be able to spend time outdoors as a family, including an aborted camping trip that got flash-flooded.
- Despite the ridiculousness of the situation, we all went to the UFL Championship Football Game hosted in STL.

## 🧑‍💻 Work

- I am still at [OpsLevel](https://www.opslevel.com/) and enjoying it. There is much more dreaming about the future and hoping that things are set up to make those dreams a possibility. Assuming that the company can deliver on some big initiatives that we are aiming for, it would be really cool to be able to help level up the product in a bunch of ways that we know we want to do.
- I have been spending more time doing back-end Rails work, which I really do not generally enjoy, but being able to help with stuff that needs to get done regardless of skill-set is a nice feeling.

## 🍿 Media Consumption

- Movie night is great, largely leaning more towards fun movies like [Independence Day](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116629/) rather than hard-hitting dramas.
- I finished the last books of Octavia Butler's, and can now confirm her as my favorite author. [Parable of the Talents](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60932.Parable_of_the_Talents) hit me really hard, and possibly due to the election, and possibly just due to being more in tune with my own mortality due to my children, it's been in my thoughts a lot.

## 🎲 Games

- Traditional rogue-likes have been more in my focus recently, with [Jupiter Hell](https://store.steampowered.com/app/811320/Jupiter_Hell/) being the most addictive. I am not at the point in my life when I can dive really deep into wikis or even into perfecting game-play, but it is a nice step back into challenge while allowing me to step out of the game if I need to handle the kids.
- The physical copy of [Slay the Spire](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/338960/slay-the-spire-the-board-game) was a nice addition to my board game collection, as well as the first single-player board game that I had fun with.

## 🎨 Creation

- Vintage Rotisserie Draft went well this quarter, but I have put the quarterly cadence on a hiatus after over 5 years. We are still going to play the events, but trying to get the Twitch streaming working and not being able to audible if people cannot make it was just very stressful.
- [Friends Builder](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/friends-builder/id1529389123) was my first app release! While I enjoyed the experience of getting an app out there and able to be used, I feel like the end of the experience left me mostly disappointed in all the things I could not do rather than happy about having finished it. There is still plenty I could add to it, but the effort versus the benefit feels like it hard to justify.
- I am spending some time making a base for building traditional roguelikes (previously I was working on a much more ambitious project with a similar ethos called Splinter) that hopefully will let me prototype roguelike ideas much faster.

## 🧠 Thinking About

- How to stay focused on projects after the initial luster wears off. Whether it is a game I am making, a hobby, or even a video game that I want to play, I find that my lack of [Grit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27213329-grit) has really been holding me back and I want to get better at it.
- Continuing my focus on time with the children, particularly Rory. It is easy to make sure to go on adventures with Logan because he wants to and gives me actual feedback afterwards, but it is equally important with Rory even though she is too little to be able to express herself.
