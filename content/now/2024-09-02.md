## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family

- We've made a tradition of going out for a meal together as a family on one day per weekend, and it has been a blast to see the kiddos grow into polite restaurant children even if they can still be monsters sometimes.
- Neem and I went to London for a trip to see Taylor Swift, but she was kind enough to let me see a bunch of historical sites as well. Stonehenge was a bore, but the inside of Parliament and Windsor were huge highlights. The concert was very cool as well, both from a vibes-aspect as well as the sheer technical achievement of it.

## 🧑‍💻 Work

- I am still at [OpsLevel](https://www.opslevel.com/) and having fun with lots of little learnings, such as drag-and-drop libraries. Still looking forward to the future, but it is nice to see technical investments that and re-organizations to support it.
- The biggest challenge has been trying to move quickly with experimental items (which is very fun) while also making sure they are built in a way to be supported by others, which is tricky given the lack of time to productionize them. It largely feels like being a sales engineer.

## 🍿 Media Consumption

- On family movie night, we have been watching [Lego Masters Australia](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10285320/) which I fully admit is not a movie, but I will not complain. I am also re-watching [The West Wing](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200276) as is a semi-yearly tradition.
- While we were in London, Neem and I spent most of the time reading books, which was delightful. The stand-out was a [meditation on being disguised as a sci-fi novel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40864002-a-psalm-for-the-wild-built).

## 🎲 Games

- [Dave the Diver](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868140/DAVE_THE_DIVER/) has been a fun game that is playable in small chunks and is great to play with the kiddos in the room. When they're not around, I have found [Cult of the Lamb](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1313140/Cult_of_the_Lamb/) to be a fun Binding of Isaac clone that is definitely not child-appropriate.
- Physical games have been tough to get to the table, but [Spirit Island](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/162886/spirit-island) is a great one that and it's been an easy one to play in 2-3 hours after kid bedtime

## 🎨 Creation

- We played another Vintage Rotisserie Draft and it was fun with less stress about making the stream perfect. I didn't do great, but it was still relaxed. I'm trying to do some [content afterwards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd74cqqCrqA).
- Despite not really knowing what I am doing with art at all, I have been playing around with making some [pixel art](https://mastodonapp.uk/@katerberg/112933568574664906). It is interesting to learn about how deep it goes, and I mostly just wish that I had the mental endurance to be able to tackle them after a full day of work. Context switching is hard!

## 🧠 Thinking About

- It is really hard to find the energy to do things after work and bedtime for the kids. It seems like there's a narrow window where I have time to do side-projects but before I start winding down (since my brain goes buzz while I need to sleep if I write code after 10pm) and I can't use it effectively.
- Spending quality time with the kiddos. Knowing that my phone will always be small but my children won't be is incredibly true, but in the moments where I feel brain-dead or annoyed, it is hard to muster the self-control to still engage with them in the way they deserve.
