## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family

- Logan has been in "Magic Class" which means that we are seeing lots of cute magic tricks, like 3-Card Monte.
- Rory is pulling herself up on furniture and is eating up a storm. She loves calling Logan "bra-bra" and getting tossed in the air.
- Neem is happy at work, but has been going through a lot of breathing difficulties including a partially collapsed lung and four cases of bronchitis this year so far.

## 🧑‍💻 Work

- I started a new job at [OpsLevel](https://opslevel.com), a dev-ops start-up that helps companies manage micro-services by creating a developer portal with visibility into architecture.
- I'm primarily spinning up on the existing application, but starting to do my traditional task of adding all of the linting rules.
- This company uses [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), so while I am spinning up on that right now for the first time, I anticipate helping with an upgrade to the latest version in the next few months.

## 🍿 Media Consumption

- My comfort television is re-runs of [Star Trek: Voyager](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112178/) and it's a common post-child-bedtime event recently.
- I rated a book as 5⭐️ on [Good Reads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55606019-mark-katerberg) which is quite rare for me. [Hero of Two Worlds](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55660735-hero-of-two-worlds) was a great dive into the life of Lafayette which I would heartily recommend to anyone who enjoyed Hamilton and wants to know more about the life of a legend of two revolutions.

## 🎲 Games

- I am nearing the end of [The Last of Us Part Two](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii/). It's brutally violent, but some of the best storytelling I've ever seen. I am loving it and feel so conflicted about all of the characters.
- Board games have been on the back burner mostly, but I am excited about a few Kickstarters that are finishing up soon, including Slay the Spire.
- I finally managed to get a lead on my MTG White Whale: a Summer Magic version of Serra Angel, which would complete my collection of every printing of this card.

## 🎨 Creation

- [Swords With Friends](https://swordswithfriends.org) was my entry to the 7 Day Roguelike contest. It is far from a perfect game, but I'm happy that I was able to get a mobile game working in that amount of time, particularly with the difficulty of multi-player.
- I built [Ormos](https://katerberg.github.io/Ormos) as a fun challenge to build a tool for a local MTG shop owner who wanted a tool to help identify which binders to look through for a list of cards. It wasn't the most technically challenging project, but it was fun to have an easy one just come together relatively easily. It was written entirely without frameworks, which made it a special challenge as well.
- Logan and I have been building Lego, recently has worked on a NASA [Space Academy](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/olivia-s-space-academy-41713).

## 🧠 Thinking About

- How to stay connected with friends without seeing them all of the time? It is pretty easy for me to feel close to people while spending lots of time with people, but harder with long-distance or just busy-life folks.
- What parts of fitness are exciting for me? Since my bicycle accident, I've been biking again and really enjoy commuting places, but have a hard time exercising for the sake of exercise. I want to be healthy but know myself well enough to not try to do things I don't enjoy since I don't maintain them.

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family

- Neem is at Stitch Fix and survived the recent lay-offs. Everyone has been sick a lot, so she has been spending time as the comfort parent more than we would like.
- Rory is getting huge. It is wild to see her grown and develop a personality. She can sit up and play, and is resisting our encouragement to crawl.
- Logan is almost 4 and is pumped for his Lego birthday party. He loves Forsyth School and constantly asks for play dates.
- Neem is going to Cancun twice in a month, once on a girls' trip and once with the family. We're going on a trip together to DC in a few weeks too.

## 🧑‍💻 Work

- I got hit by the lay-offs at Stitch Fix so I'm spending time taking care of kids while figuring out longer term plans.
- Interviewing is exhausting, and doubly so because I am mostly just responding to people reaching out to me rather than looking for a company I really want so far.

## 🍿 Media Consumption

- The Last Of Us has been amazing. I really think it is better than the game so far, which is surprising since that one is the best narrative game I have played.
- Movie Night on Thursdays have been really rewarding. [Marriage Story](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7653254/) was one of the best films I have seen and it was so painful to watch that I never want to think of it again.
- My [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55606019-mark-katerberg) shows that I am 7 books ahead of my goal of 30 books for the year. Audiobooks have been amazing to let me read things I would not normally find the time for but value.

## 🎲 Games

- [Vintage Rotisserie Draft at St Lotus](https://stlotus.org) came back and went really well. We have a "Friends and Family" one in a week that will be lower stakes but more fun since I get to play in it.
- I got to play [Blood Bowl Team Manager](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/90137/blood-bowl-team-manager-card-game) at the Super Bowl and it was a fun quick deck builder. I want to dig more into that genre since it feels like it is less awkward than drafting while still having variance I enjoy.
- The PS5 is still for Fortnite, but at least I am replaying The Last Of Us.

## 🎨 Creation

- 7 Day RogueLike is coming up fast. We are ditching the social media game since it was too hard to make a Roguelike and we are just going to try a mobile multiplayer Rogue instead.
- I have been doing a few little games that are mostly to try out things I don't know well such as mobile interfaces, but [Sigils](/web-dev) has been fun to build so far.
- Logan and I wrote a tiny book from stapled paper this weekend. It is fun to watch him create and be a part of that process with him, even if it is for little stuff that won't last other than in memories.

## 🧠 Thinking About

- What work success means to me still. Money is feeling like a constraint to my career right now, since most of the interesting companies pay worse than the amount that I set as my lower-bound. I am worried that I am boxing myself out of work happiness.
- How to do more than survive with kids. When they are sick or in crisis, it is easy to constantly tell myself that "I just need to get through this" but I realize that I am sleepwalking through life with that defense.
