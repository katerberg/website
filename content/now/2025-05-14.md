## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family

- The kids got to spend time with their cousins since we went on a trip to the [Crown Ridge Tiger Sanctuary](https://crownridgetigers.com/) for Bethany and my birthday. Seeing the Tigers from 4 feet away and learning about them was great, but the time together (with a surprise visit by Tim and his family) was the true magic.
- Neem went on a bunch of trips for work, but Logan and I went on a Cub Scouts Camporee at [S-F Scout Ranch](https://stlbsa.org/properties/s-bar-f-scout-ranch/). It involved fishing, canoeing, sleeping on the ground, and learning safety techniques of all sorts.
- We went to the Red Wings vs Blues game, per a somewhat annual tradition, and this time, instead of going with Neem, I went with Logan and a few friends. It was a great time that ended with Logan nearly falling asleep on the MetroLink and talking about it for days.

## 🧑‍💻 Work

- I made a tough decision to leave [OpsLevel](https://www.opslevel.com/) to go to [Maestro QA](https://www.maestroqa.com/). It is a start-up that is focused on making call centers and customer support better. Since all of the funding in the world is currently only going to AI-focused areas, I wanted to be in that space, but most of the use-cases are pretty suspect to me. This company has actually compelling use-cases that are focused on the problems instead of on the technology.
- It sounds like I will be going to to be traveling about once a quarter for meet-ups with the team, which I am hoping will really help me stay engaged, since I thrive on the uplifting energy in my workplace, and that is a tricky thing to do purely remotely.

## 🍿 Media Consumption

- Movie Night every week is still a high-point of my week, with more silly films this quarter like [Demolition Man](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106697/) and [Bringing Up Baby](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029947), but also with harder hitting films like [8½](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056801/).
- I am always reading 2-3 books at once, but the most impactful so far this quarter has been [House of Leaves](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24800.House_of_Leaves), which is a strange-horror book that is the most ambitious non-religious text I have encountered. I am looking forward to finishing it to have more thoughts, but you can always track what I am reading at my [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55606019).

## 🎲 Games

- I was gifted a [MSI Claw](https://www.msi.com/Handhelds/Claw-7-AI-Plus-A2VMX) handheld gaming computer which has re-sparked my interest in a bunch of games I have been unable to play on Mac computers, so my [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049021576/) profile has been more active than usual.
- [Spiritfall](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1835240/Spiritfall/) (Super Smash Bros mixed with Hades) has probably been the biggest winner of my time recently, but there have just been a lot of new games that I've been able to try and I am enjoying the exploration.

## 🎨 Creation

- This year I opted to skip the [7 Day Roguelike](https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2025) since life was just a bit too chaotic. I really missed out on it and there are a few game ideas that are spinning in my head even though none of them fit cleanly in the "Roguelike" genre.
- One of the biggest ideas I have had is just to clean up some of my previous 7DRLs into releasable Steam games that are $5. It would require some time, and require learning how to publish things, but it would be nice to have them available for people to play as more than just tech demos. The thing holding me back is the lack of time constraint on the process. Since it is not a one-week project, the games feel like they are likely to seem incomplete rather than a nice example of what is doable in 7 days.

## 🧠 Thinking About

- How to function with ADHD. I have gone to therapy for a month or so, but feel like most of the therapy has been intellectualizing the experiences rather than trying new strategies to be better able to accomplish goals. Some of this certainly comes from the lack of concrete goals, but it is all connected since the lack of goal-setting comes from the likely inability to achieve them to the level that makes me happy (all-or-nothing thinking, which is deeply common in ADHD).
- What do to after school for the kiddos. There is a about a two-hour window of time after pick up where they need to eat, get ready for bed, and ideally have some family experiences that are positive. It is hard to find the right things to fit in the 30-60 minute window of time to help them feel like a part of the family without making the necessary activities fall through the cracks.
