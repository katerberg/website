## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family

- Everyone is back to relatively good health and we are exploring the world together. I've been trying to prioritize going outside with the kiddos more while we have the opportunity, which led us to going up in the Arch.
- One of the things I try to focus on with little kiddos is how to ensure that we don't just get focused on the day to day, but can actually build traditions that they will remember. One of the biggest for me is cultural heritage, particularly around St Nicholas Day, where we put out wooden shoes and fill them with oranges and treats for the kids.
- For Christmas this year, we were separated from each other since Neem and Ororo hung back in St Louis, while Logan and I went to Grand Rapids to spend the holiday with my parents. It was so nice to share some of my holiday traditions with him, but also sad to miss Christmas with the girls.

## 🧑‍💻 Work

- I am working at OpsLevel, where it's a pretty relaxed culture while still exposing me to enough new things that I am having a good time. Since we don't have a lot of the other things I am used to, such as a design department a strong engineering culture of design-focus, it has been a fun journey trying to identify what things are actually useful to fight for, and what things are not needed yet. Series A start-ups are hard!
- The longer I spend doing front-end focused work in start-up culture, the more I wonder if I would be better suited to either diversify into a more generic skill-set (which would probably be better if I want to be a first-four engineer) or slide back towards Fortune 500 companies. It is hard to feel like you are helping your co-workers as much as you could be while still staying specialized.

## 🍿 Media Consumption

- Movies have still had a hold on my heart, with weekly movie nights which range from the silly with [The Fly](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091064/), to the serious with [The Hustler](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054997/).
- Reading snuck up on me, which I discovered when I realized that I have [read seventy books this year](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55606019-mark-katerberg). Some of the stand-outs were [a biography of Lafayette](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55660735-hero-of-two-worlds), a [leadership book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40109367-dare-to-lead), and [one of the latest by Sanderson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60531406-tress-of-the-emerald-sea).

## 🎲 Games

- I have largely been spending my time gaming on casual mobile games, such as Marvel Snap and Pokemon Go. Although I have done well with them, they alternate between boredom-fillers and chores. I look forward to the kiddos being old enough to spend more time without direct involvement so I can play games that require more continual focus, but I genuinely love that I am choosing to spend my time focusing on them instead of trying to play games.
- Table-top role playing games are even more of a time commitment, but I recently ran [a holiday one-off](https://www.pennydragon.games/product/the-fight-before-christmas-pdf/) that was fun because it was low-stakes and let me still get a little invested with a group of friends.

## 🎨 Creation

- My free time creating has been largely focused on [St Lotus](https://stlotus.org) this quarter. Not only did I play in an event in Chicago (where we soundly defeated them), but I also ran another event in St Louis. On top of all of that, I have started creating [YouTube Shorts](https://www.youtube.com/@stlotus/shorts) in consumable one minute videos talking about Vintage Rotisserie Draft which has recaptured some of the fun for it for me.
- Since I know that the next [7 Day RogueLike](https://7drl.com/) is happening in March, I've been toying around with a framework for making a traditional roguelike. It's still more chore than fun at this point, but my hope is that if I get it to a useable state, it will make the game development during the game-jam more focused on mechanics and fun than on rote-coding.

## 🧠 Thinking About

- How to keep energy more consistent with the kids. I love that I can spend time with them and devote my life to making theirs as good as I can, but in my worst moments, I know that I am being dismissive. I don't want to flood them with affection one moment and stand-off the next, so I'm thinking of ways to remind them that I love them even when I can't deal with them in those moments.
- What work means when it isn't something I want to be the focal point for my life. I still care about helping others, but it isn't something that I want to spend the majority of my waking day thinking about, and finding a way to accept that it likely means letting some aspirations go is a thing I am dealing with.
