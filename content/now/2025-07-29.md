## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family

- Our family has been on several trips together this summer, including two trips to Michigan where the kids got to see their grandparents and some cousins at [Dutch Village](https://www.dutchvillage.com/), a Dutch-themed amusement park that was a core memory of my childhood.
- Our nuclear family went to Kansas City with no agenda, and it was a reminder that low-stakes road trips are really my favorite. It can be wonderful to visit with others, but the people I love most are often the ones I take for granted, and it is just wonderful to spend time together when we are not trying to rush to something in particular. We spent almost three hours in [Level One](https://levelonegameshop.com/), a local board game shop just showing each other things we liked.
- Neem went to Italy on a cheese trip and also took her regular Mother's Day weekend in a hotel. I went on a couple trips with friends without her or the kids. All of these trips without each other were really nice to remember why I like her enough to miss her. It can be hard to both work in the same place that you live together all the time, regardless of how much you love each other!

## 🧑‍💻 Work

- [Maestro QA](https://www.maestroqa.com/) is going well and I have two work trips scheduled, which is more than what I did in my entire last two years at my previous company. It is really hard starting at a new company without knowing anyone, but things are going well even though I am doing more infrastructure and architecture work than I anticipated.
- Some of the struggles with chaotic start-ups are hitting me, but it is largely just the lack of clear direction on what I need to be doing given that there is so much opportunity to choose my own adventure there. I am looking forward to doing more customer-facing features soon.

## 🍿 Media Consumption

- Lots of movies as always, including [Superman](https://mastodonapp.uk/@katerberg/114894854141018546), which was a delightfully campy romp, but the stand-out was [Fantastic Mr Fox](https://mastodonapp.uk/@katerberg/114874743492835087), which is shocking because I find Wes Anderson to be fairly yawn-worthy most of the time.
- Now fully caught up on the [Dungeon Crawler Carl](https://www.goodreads.com/series/309211-dungeon-crawler-carl) series, I am kinda bummed that I have to wait for the next one until 2026. They are violent, offensive, and downright silly, but they have kept my interest and excitement like no series since [Bobiverse](https://www.goodreads.com/series/192752-bobiverse). Having a break from them has let me start digging back into [Sanderson](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38550.Brandon_Sanderson), who has more books than a human could expect to read in a decade.

## 🎲 Games

- In the past two months, I have gone on three board game trips. One to Las Vegas for some light gambling, one to [Geekway](https://geekway.com/) for four days of complicated board games, and one to BenCon at the [Gamers Ranch](https://gamersranch.com/).
- In video game world, I have mostly logged hours into [Shogun Showdown](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2084000/Shogun_Showdown/), where I completed all of the achievements other than one, which would take at least 100 hours more to get, so I will probably take a break from that for a while.

## 🎨 Creation

- Not much has been happening for my creative outlets recently since most of my energy has been driving into work and family obligations. It was pretty disheartening to have my five week gap in work basically get eaten alive by acts of god that knocked kids out of school, but at least it is a good reason to not feel mad at myself about not getting a game out the door in that time.
- One of my struggles has been that a lot of the joy I get from exploring development happens while I am completing the rote tasks needed in development, and those can largely be done by AI, which gives my brain very little time to bask and explore. I am trying to supplement this with walks or other creativity-driving endeavors, but not having much luck with it yet.

## 🧠 Thinking About

- What a good marriage looks like. We are looking at [minivans](https://www.toyota.com/sienna/) and finding places where we compromise without becoming resentful of each other is hard even though we share 95% of our values. Being a good spouse and parent is absolutely the priority, and doing so in a way that keeps me as a whole person that is adding to those relationships is a constant balancing.
- How to prioritize friendships without feeling drained. As much as I value seeing people, it can be really tiring and I enjoy time just being able to process things alone. Some of the friendships I value most are the ones where we go on walks or just wander talking about things instead of doing an activity (even one as simple as dinner) and I want to foster those types of activities more. It feels like it is much easier to actually build deep relationships when you are not focused on an activity, but obviously that is not a thing you can just jump into. Finding a way to transition from a lighter form of friendship that centers around activity into a deeper form that centers around caring for and fostering each other's goals is not easy.
