Some of the friendships I value most are the ones where we go on walks or just wander talking about things instead of doing an activity (even one as simple as dinner) and I want to foster those types of activities more. It feels like it is much easier to actually build deep relationships when you are not focused on an activity, but obviously that is not a thing you can just jump into. Finding a way to transition from a lighter form of friendship that centers around activity into a deeper form that centers around caring for and fostering each other’s goals is not easy.</li></ul></section></div><hr/><h2>History</h2><div class="Now_history__C56PK"><div><p class="Now_lastUpdated__xlWtM">Updated 2025-05-14</p><section class="Now_section__YqKb4"><h3 class="Now_sectionHeader__4ND1Y">👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family</h3><ul class="Now_sectionContent__7C4oH"><li class="Now_sectionContentItem__lLjTb">The kids got to spend time with their cousins since we went on a trip to the<!-- --> <a href="https://crownridgetigers.com/">Crown Ridge Tiger Sanctuary</a> <!-- -->for Bethany and my birthday.
