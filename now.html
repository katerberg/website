Recently a group reached out to me and we are running another game in it. The conceit of the game is that players schedule time to play and tell me what they want to go explore, but the world is large enough and fleshed out already, so the prep work for me is fairly minimal. This has made it so much more fun to DM since I am largely not scrambling to come up with something and can instead focus on making the session fun.</li></ul></section><section class="Now_section__YqKb4"><h3 class="Now_sectionHeader__4ND1Y">🧠 Thinking About</h3><ul class="Now_sectionContent__7C4oH"><li class="Now_sectionContentItem__lLjTb">Figuring out what I want to get out of therapy has been a consideration.
