# Cursor Rules for Website Project

## Formatting
- **Always use 2-space indentation** (not 4 spaces)
- The project uses Prettier with ESLint integration
- Prettier config: 2 spaces, single quotes, semicolons, ES5 trailing commas
- EditorConfig is configured - respect `.editorconfig` settings
- **Important**: Cursor's auto-format should match Prettier settings. If auto-save is changing formatting, check that Cursor is using the project's Prettier config, not default settings.

## Linting
- Always run `npm run lint:fix` after making changes to ensure linting passes
- Fix any linting errors before committing code
- The project uses ESLint with Next.js configuration and Prettier integration
- ESLint enforces Prettier rules via `eslint-plugin-prettier`

## Code Style
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Prefer functional components in React
- Use 2-space indentation consistently

## Build Process
- The feed generation script runs automatically before builds
- Always test locally with `npm run build` before pushing
